Automated checkout system for corporate cafeterias

## 1. Executive summary
In many large companies and factories, cafeterias are a key service that must be provided, offering
meals to employees who have taken time from their schedule for a break. Most of these depend on
cashiers for a manual transaction in which employees pick up their food and head toward a checkout
line. This process, as functional as it is, leads to several inefficiencies, particularly during peak times.
Long lines often form, reducing the amount of time employees have to eat and at times making them
late to get back to work.
The situation has continuously deteriorated during the last years, especially after the COVID-19
pandemic, with more and more employees coming back to office work. With increased employee
presence, cafeteria operations have taken on growing work strain that results in bottlenecks at
cashier stations. Besides influencing employees' experience, such inefficiency reduces productivity in
general.
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and IoT technologies such as affordable camera
systems and machine learning algorithms, offer a chance to solve the problem. Using AI for the
automation of checkout would identify food items and directly charge those to employees' accounts
without any human involvement. These promise streamlined operations, reduced queue time, and
increased employee satisfaction due to being able to use their break time more appropriately.

## 2. Problem statement
Currently, company cafeterias rely on manual checkout processes, leading to long lines and
inefficiencies. However, this results in reduced employee break times and potential delays in
returning to work. Therefore, an automated system that uses AI to identify food items and charge
employees directly is needed to streamline the checkout process.

## 3. Motivation
I have always been passionate about using technology to find solutions for operational problems
within the business context, especially in terms of how those things can be optimized in a business
context for efficiency. In my work as Director of Illinois Business Consulting, I successfully applied
technology to various processes. This includes developing software for consultant recruitment and
using data for performance evaluations. This project provides another opportunity for me to enhance
these skills by considering a hardware-based problem in IoT.
Recently, while speaking to the VP of Operations at a Fortune 500 company, I asked him, "What
keeps you up at night?" They had just moved to fully in person work model and mentioned the
problem identified in the problem statement - bottlenecks at cafeteria cashier stations resulting in
inefficiencies during employee lunch breaks. This piqued my interest as this is the exact type of
problem I hope to solve in my career.
The given assignment focuses on the development of an IoT solution. This is an excellent opportunity
to create a practical technology-driven system that not only will meet course objectives but also
address a real-life business challenge.
Solving this problem could go further and be applied in other high traffic situations such as airports,
hospitals, malls, etc. By addressing this issue in this context, the underlying solution could be applied
to a broad variety of areas.

• Identify the best solution for food recognition that maximizes efficiency and reduces false
results
• Test employee identification methods (RFID or facial recognition)
• Identify the best employee identification method
• Document testing methodologies to be included in final report
• Document reasoning for employee identification method selection
### Phase 3 – Develop final product
Oct. 28 – Nov. 24
• Combine modules into a final product using the best employee identification method
• Document any bugs seen and solutions to them
• Conduct testing and note any false positive or false negatives
### Phase 4 – Write final paper and develop demo video
Nov. 25 – Dec. 15
• Write final paper that details the process as described in prior phases
